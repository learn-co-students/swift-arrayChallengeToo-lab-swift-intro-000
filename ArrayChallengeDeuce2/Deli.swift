         In its implementation, it should add the name passed into this argument to the line stored property on the Deli class. (Exactly what that sentence means is explained when we get to the section on Classes). For now, you can see that line is created for you as an empty array of String 's. You can utilize this variable within all of the functions you create, you have full access to it.
         If the persons name is Billy Crystal, they should be positioned at the front of the line.
         If the persons name is Meg Ryan, they should be positioned at the front of the line.
         Everyone else should be added to the back of the line and wait their turn.
         The String this function should return is based on the following conditions (x represents the individuals name, y represents their position in line).
         If the person is first in line: "Welcome x, you're first in line!"
         If the persons name is Billy Crystal: "Welcome Billy Crystal! You can sit wherever you like."
         If the persons name is Meg Ryan: "Welcome Meg Ryan! You can sit wherever you like."
         Every other situation: "Welcome x, you're number y in line."

         This function should take no arguments but return back a String.

         Otherwise, return a String beginning with the "The line is:", and appending every customer in the line on a new line \n beginning with their number in the line. For example, if our line was represented as:
         var line = ["Albert Einstein", "Cher", "Neil deGrasse Tyson", "Yoshi"]
         The String to be returned should look like this:
